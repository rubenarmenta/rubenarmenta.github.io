### CPSC 120

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-03-rubenarmenta/tree/master/part-1)

    Lab 3, part 1, was one of my favorite labs because I created a mad libs
    program. In this program, you fill in the blanks to form a sentence about
    what you want on a sandwich. From Lab 3, I learned how to declare variables
    and write statements for the program to run.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-dang-huynh-ruben-armenta/tree/master/part-1)

    Lab 5, part 1, was another one of my favorite labs because it was
    essentially a continuation of Lab 3, part 1. However, we would be using a
    different approach to run our program. From Lab 5, part 1, I learned how to
    create a program that would read from command line arguments instead of
    standard input.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-ryan-ruben/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 8, part 1, was another one of my favorite labs because I found it
    interesting to create a program that could identify any words spelled the
    same forwards and backward. Although I found this lab a little confusing, I
    am glad my partner was able to help me. From Lab 8, part 1, I learned how to
    write code for the program to open and read from a file.
